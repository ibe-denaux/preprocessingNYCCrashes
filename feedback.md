Very thorough and impressive cleaning, and your project is very well organized. Here are some general points that could be improved:
1. We require fully numerical data for a model, but your final cleaned data still contains categorical string data.
2. watch your indentations insider your functions, too many imply you might need more functions
3. flattening might help you reduce the amount of dimensions you have
4. use type hinting in your functions to help reduce the number of comments (you have a lot)

Overall, very good.
